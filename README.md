# Maladum Rich Event Cards

Maladum Rich Event Cards is an independent structured-card version of the Maladum event deck app. It renders event cards from local JSON text, token, and icon metadata instead of using scanned card images as the primary play surface.

This project was split from `C:\Users\barry\Projects\maladumeventcards` at source commit `0a68b63a7caf3df4047a5832842c56e86812b564` and now has its own repository state.

## Runtime Model

The app now supports a mixed card catalog:

- `maladumcards.json` remains the legacy compatibility source and extraction seed.
- `data/cards/manifest.json` defines the structured rich-card catalog.
- `data/cards/*.json` store per-game structured cards with stable ids, tokenized text, footer metadata, and extraction state.
- `data/cards/icons.json` maps token names to local SVG assets in `assets/icons/`.

At runtime, cards from the legacy catalog normalize to `renderMode: "image"` and continue to render from `cardimages/*`. Cards from `data/cards/*.json` normalize to `renderMode: "rich"` and render from structured JSON with DOM-safe tokenized text.

## Card Format

Rich cards use bracket tokens inside text:

- `Take 2 [fire] damage.`
- `Move [move:3].`
- `Discard on a [skull].`

Inline tokens preserve printed word order. Legacy `[icon:fire]` syntax is accepted during migration and normalized to `[fire]`.

A rich card record looks like this:

```json
{
  "id": 50,
  "card": "Fresh Graves",
  "slug": "fresh-graves",
  "type": "Revenant + Veteran",
  "game": "Base Game",
  "sourceImage": "Fresh_Graves.png",
  "renderMode": "rich",
  "sections": [
    {
      "kind": "mode",
      "label": "DISQUIET",
      "text": "Increase Dread by 1 and shuffle this card back into the deck."
    }
  ],
  "footer": {
    "left": [{ "type": "icon", "name": "grave" }],
    "right": []
  },
  "tokens": {
    "style": "inline-bracket"
  },
  "searchText": "fresh graves revenant veteran increase dread by 1",
  "extraction": {
    "status": "needs-review",
    "confidence": 0.83,
    "issues": ["footer icons auto-detected"],
    "managedBy": "extractor"
  }
}
```

## Commands

Install build-time tooling once:

```bash
npm install
```

Common commands:

```bash
npm test
npm run validate:cards
npm run extract:cards
npm run extract:cards:openrouter
npm run review:cards
npm run build
```

Notes:

- `npm run extract:cards` runs the structured extractor with OCR enabled.
- `npm run extract:cards:openrouter` runs an optional multimodal enrichment pass against existing rich cards. It requires `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.
- `npm run review:cards` builds `reports/card-review/index.html`.
- `npm run build` refreshes `service-worker.js` from `version.json` and rebuilds the cached asset manifest.

## Extraction Workflow

The extractor lives in `scripts/extract-cards.mjs` and works like this:

1. Read `maladumcards.json`.
2. Group cards by source image.
3. Inspect `cardimages/<contents>` with template-relative regions for title, section headers, bodies, and footer areas.
4. Seed structured sections from the existing legacy `sections` data.
5. Normalize inline icon tokens into bracket syntax.
6. Attempt OCR for region confirmation when enabled.
7. Emit per-game rich JSON, plus `data/cards/extraction-report.json`.
8. Optionally run `npm run extract:cards:openrouter` to improve seeded footer/icon extraction on cards that still need review.

Human-edited or verified records are preserved on rerun unless `--force` is passed.
The OpenRouter enrichment step only promotes clean automated results to `auto`; cards with unresolved icons or other ambiguity remain `needs-review`.

## Reviewing And Editing Cards

Manual review is expected during migration.

- Open [reports/card-review/index.html](reports/card-review/index.html) after running `npm run review:cards`.
- Compare the source image on the left with the structured render and raw extraction metadata on the right.
- Cards are marked `auto`, `needs-review`, or `verified`.
- Keep uncertain text or icons explicit. Use placeholders like `[unknown-icon]` rather than guessing.

If you manually fix a card, update its `extraction` block accordingly. Use `managedBy: "human"` or `status: "verified"` for records that should not be overwritten by a later extractor rerun without `--force`.

## Adding Or Editing Cards

For a new or updated card:

1. Add or update the legacy entry in `maladumcards.json` if needed.
2. Run `npm run extract:cards`.
3. Review the generated rich record in `data/cards/<game>.json`.
4. Correct text, footer metadata, tags, or extraction flags.
5. Run `npm run validate:cards` and `npm test`.
6. Run `npm run review:cards` if you want a visual review page.

## Adding Icons

1. Add an SVG under `assets/icons/`.
2. Register it in `data/cards/icons.json` with `aliases`, `kind`, `asset`, and notes.
3. Use the icon name inside bracket tokens such as `[fire]` or `[move:3]`.
4. Run `npm run validate:cards`.

## Migration Notes

- The deck builder, type parsing, and stable ids are unchanged.
- Search now uses title, type, game, and extracted rules text via normalized `searchText`.
- Legacy image-backed cards still work during migration because normalization preserves `contents` and `sourceImage`.
- The service worker now caches structured card JSON and local SVG icon assets as part of the app shell.

## Current Extractor Limitations

- Footer icon matching is intentionally conservative and currently defaults many detected footer glyphs to `unknown-icon`.
- OCR is used as confirmation and review input, not as an unquestioned source of truth.
- Complex inline icon extraction from body text still relies heavily on legacy seeded text and needs manual review when placeholders remain.
